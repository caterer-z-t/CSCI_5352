\section*{Problem 1}

\textit{\textbf{Need to fix, complete, and check this proof.}}\\
Let the total number of nodes in the network be \( n = n_A + n_B \). The closeness centrality of a node \( i \) is defined as:
\[
C_i = \frac{n-1}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} d(i,j)}
\]
where \( d(i) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} d(i,j) \) represents the sum of shortest path distances from node \( i \) to all other nodes.

We aim to show the relationship between the closeness centralities \( C_A \) and \( C_B \) of vertices \( A \) and \( B \). 

Define Distance Sums
The sum of distances from node \( A \) is:
\[
d(A) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} d(A,j) = \sum_{j \in A} d(A,j) + \sum_{j \in B} d(A,j)
\]
Similarly, for node \( B \):
\[
d(B) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} d(B,j) = \sum_{j \in B} d(B,j) + \sum_{j \in A} d(B,j)
\]

 Express Distance Relations
Define:
\[
S_A = \sum_{j \in A} d(A,j), \quad S_B = \sum_{j \in B} d(B,j)
\]
where \( S_A \) is the total sum of distances from \( A \) to all nodes in \( A \), and \( S_B \) is the sum of distances from \( B \) to all nodes in \( B \).

Since the two subnetworks are connected by a single edge, each node in \( B \) is one unit farther from \( A \) than from \( B \), and vice versa:
\[
\sum_{j \in B} d(A,j) = \sum_{j \in B} (d(B,j) + 1) = S_B + n_B
\]
\[
\sum_{j \in A} d(B,j) = \sum_{j \in A} (d(A,j) + 1) = S_A + n_A
\]

Compute \( d(A) \) and \( d(B) \)
\[
d(A) = S_A + (S_B + n_B) = S_A + S_B + n_B
\]
\[
d(B) = S_B + (S_A + n_A) = S_A + S_B + n_A
\]

Compute Closeness Centralities
\[
C_A = \frac{n-1}{d(A)} = \frac{n-1}{S_A + S_B + n_B}
\]
\[
C_B = \frac{n-1}{d(B)} = \frac{n-1}{S_A + S_B + n_A}
\]


Taking reciprocals:
\[
\frac{1}{C_A} = \frac{S_A + S_B + n_B}{n-1}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{C_B} = \frac{S_A + S_B + n_A}{n-1}
\]
Dividing both equations:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{C_A}}{\frac{1}{C_B}} = \frac{S_A + S_B + n_B}{S_A + S_B + n_A} = \frac{n_B}{n_A}
\]
Rearranging:
\[
\frac{1}{C_A} n_A = \frac{1}{C_B} n_B
\]
Multiplying by \( \frac{1}{n} \):
\[
\frac{1}{C_A} n_A \frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{C_B} n_B \frac{1}{n}
\]

Thus, we have proven the required relationship:
\[
\frac{1}{C_A} \frac{n_A}{n} = \frac{1}{C_B} \frac{n_B}{n}
\]

\subsection*{Part A}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Selection Criteria:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Randomly select two directed edges \( (u,v) \) and \( (x,y) \) from the network.
        \item Since it is a directed network, the order of the nodes in the edge matters. Thus, the two edges are distinct.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Possible output configurations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Option 1: \( (u, x)\)and \( (v, y) \)
        \item Option 2: \( (u, y)\)and \( (v, x) \)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Checkes needed on $G'$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ensure no self loops.
        \item Ensure no multiple edges.
        \item Verify the $k^{in}$ and $k^{out}$ values of the nodes remain unchanged.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part B}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Selection Criteria:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Randomly select two directed edges one from each partition, for simplicity sake lets say nodes \( u \) and \( v \) are from partition \( A \) and nodes \( x \) and \( y \) are from partition \( B \). So the two edges are \( (u,x) \) and \( (v,y) \).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Possible output configurations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The only option: \( (u, y)\) and \( (v, x) \)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Checkes needed on $G'$:   
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ensure no self loops.
        \item Ensure no multiple edges.
        \item Verify the degrees of the nodes remain unchanged.
        \item Veriy the new edges maintain bipartite structure.
    \end{itemize}
